3. Essentially, the eigen operator is the differential operator. The eigenvalue represents the gradient of a cost-function's curve (i.e. from areas of high error descending to low error areas. The point of knowing this is to 1. determine which features are the best indicators for a range of outputs and 2. to know in which direction of eigenvalues to trend so that the cost function ultimately reaches its global minimum therby producing values with an error rate very very near 0.

4. The "Hessian" or "Hessian Matrix" is a list of values which represent the slope of the cost-functions curve at a given data point. The Hessian values basically tell the algorithm 1. which direction comprises the steepest gradient toward a global minimum and 2. what direction that gradient is in.
